This project focuses on building a logistic regression model in Python to predict the probability of an NBA playoff team winning the championship based on their regular season statistics. Using historical NBA data from 27 seasons (spanning 432 playoff teams), we explored how various metrics influence championship outcomes, including win percentage, field goal accuracy, turnovers, and free throw rankings. The analysis aims to provide insights for sports analytics, betting strategies, and team management.

In order to see a good overview of our insights and regression model, please look at the FINAL PROJECT DATA excel file. 

Additionally look towards the FINAL REGRESSION CODE to see more of the background of the logistic regression utilizing Python libraries, which helps refines the model iteratively by identifying and removing multicollinearity and statistically insignificant variables.
It also helps evaluate the model performance through LLR p-values, regression coefficients, and prediction probabilities, and helps visualizes championship probability results with Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
