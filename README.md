This project focuses on building a logistic regression model in Python to predict the probability of an NBA playoff team winning the championship based on their regular season statistics. Using historical NBA data from 27 seasons (spanning 432 playoff teams), we explored how various metrics influence championship outcomes, including win percentage, field goal accuracy, turnovers, and free throw rankings. The analysis aims to provide insights for sports analytics, betting strategies, and team management.
